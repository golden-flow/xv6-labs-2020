Q Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing.

Two threads may insert different new keys to the same bucket concurrently. The following
sequence may occur:

    THREAD 1                      THREAD 2
    e->key = key;
                                  e->key = key;
    e->value = value;              
                                  e->value = value;
    e->next = n;
                                  e->next = n;
    *p = e;
                                  *p = e;
    (the value of n is identical in both threads)

The two next pointers point to the same entry. One of the new entries is assigned to
*p, and the other entry will be lost.
