RISC-V assembly
---------------

Q Which registers contain arguments to functions?

Registers a0, a1 and a2. Specifically, a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf.

Q Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?

The function f is not called in main. It is hardcoded in the instruction `li a1, 12` at 0x26. The function g is inlined in function f.

Q At what address is function printf located?

0x628.

Q What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38.

Q What is the output of the code?

  unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
  printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

The output is "HE110 World". If the RISC-V were big-endian, i should be set to 0x726c6400. 57616 need not changing.

Q What is going to be printed after 'y=' for printf("x=%d y=%d", 3); ?

Garbage (or what is left in a2 when printf is called).
