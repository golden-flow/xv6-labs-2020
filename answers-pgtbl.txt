1. Print a page table

Q: Explain the output of vmprint.

User memory grows upward from page 0. Page 510 and 511 are the trapframe and 
trampoline page respectively.

Q: What does page 0 contain?

Page 0 contains the text and data segments of the init process.

Q: What is in page 2?

Page 2 contains the user stack.

Q: Could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1 when running in 
user mode?

No. The corresponding PTE for page 1 has the User bit turned off.

3. Simplify copyin/copyinstr

Q: Why is the third test srcva + len < srcva necessary in copyin_new()?

This is to prevent an overflow when adding len to srcva. This will happen when 
srcva=0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF, and len=0x1.
